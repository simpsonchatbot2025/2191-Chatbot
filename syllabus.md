Course Name(s) and Number(s): 
This is the information for my three courses that are structured similarly:
* Department of Political Science POL SCI 2141B 650: Global Violence & Injustice 
* Department of Political Science POL SCI 2191A 650: Special Topics in Poli Sci: Global Diplomacy and Peace
* Department of Political Science POL SCI 2135A 650: Canada Abroad

Date(s) and Time(s) Offered: 
2141A Online Course, Distance Studies (fall term), September 2025-December 2025.  
2191B Online Course, Distance Studies (fall term), September 2025 - April 2025.    
2135A Online Course, Distance Studies (winter term), January 2026 – April 2026.

All due dates will be posted on the OWL Calendar. They are not listed in this Course Outline. Please check the OWL Calendar regularly for updates. The Final Version of the Course Syllabus will be posted on Western’s online learning management system (OWL) by the third lesson (before the official drop date). 

Online Quizzes and Exams (not in-person and not proctored):
Course deadlines will be announced through the OWL Calendar. They do not appear in this Course Outline. Students are responsible for checking the OWL Calendar frequently for updates.
The Mid-term Exam, a 2-hour multiple-choice test with 80 questions, focuses on information covered in Required Readings, Slides and Audio Lectures from Classes 1-6. No bonus questions or marks are included, and it excludes content from the Engage More Readings. 

Similarly, the Final Exam mirrors the Mid-term, featuring a 2-hour multiple-choice format with 80 questions of varying difficulty. Non-cumulative, it assesses information from Classes 7-12.

The quizzes are also online. The online quizzes and exams are not in person and do not use Proctortrack, as it raises concerns regarding student equity, privacy, and reliability.

Course Syllabus
Each week’s required readings and lectures will be released as soon as possible. Students are expected to review the assigned materials during that week before the next set of lectures is released. Lessons are accessible on OWL at your convenience in preparation for the Mid-term and Final Exams.

Attendance is not recorded, and there are no participation marks. Written answers to questions are not required. However, all lectures—including guest lectures—and all required readings will be tested. The “Engage More” readings are not included. Please note that OWL Brightspace records detailed analytics, including the amount of time spent on each lecture and the duration of each quiz and exam attempt. This information may be reviewed to detect irregularities, and any evidence of academic dishonesty will be investigated under the University’s Academic Integrity policy and may result in formal sanctions, including referral to the Dean’s office.

This Course Outline constitutes a contract between the instructor and the students enrolled in the course. Changes are normally not made after the Course Outline is reviewed online (usually during the first class) and no later than the third lesson (prior to the official drop date).

Due dates are not listed in this Course Outline. Instead, all due dates will be posted on the Calendar Tool in OWL as soon as they are confirmed. Students are responsible for consulting the OWL Calendar regularly for updates.

If a date must be changed, the instructor will provide at least two weeks’ notice whenever possible. In exceptional cases, shorter notice may be required.

Lecture and Exam Location Details
This course is delivered entirely online through asynchronous instruction. Pre-recorded PowerPoint lectures with the Professor’s audio are provided in YouTube, mp4, and pptx formats, allowing you to access materials at your convenience.
Two quizzes and two exams will be written online from your home. Quizzes are one hour in length and must be completed within a 5-day window. The Mid-term and Final Exams are two hours each and must be completed during an 8-hour window.
Important requirement: The Mid-term and Final Exams must be written between 12:00 PM and 8:00 PM (EST/EDT). A stable Wi-Fi connection is required for the full 2-hour exam. Students are responsible for ensuring their internet and technical setup are reliable. Technical issues during the exam will not be grounds for extensions or rescheduling. Students in different time zones, or those traveling or working full- or part-time, can still complete the course as long as they meet this requirement.

Additional Synchronous Activities are not possible:
Given the course's asynchronous nature and a considerable number of students, Simulations or Roleplaying Exercises are not included. Synchronous activities in these areas may be available through registration in my other courses (e.g. POL SCI 3203F: International Crises).


Course Access, Language, and Prerequisites

Prerequisites: None
This elective has no prerequisites or antirequisites and welcomes students from all campuses. With a winter term enrollment of 1,500 students and a waiting list exceeding 100, the course structure and reading expectations align with other 2100-level cross-campus courses taught by Professor Simpson.

English as a Second Language (ESL) and International Students
ESL and international students are encouraged to enroll, regardless of prior experience in politics or Canadian history. There are no English writing requirements. However, the course follows standardized expectations for an online Canadian university class. Grades are assigned according to Canadian university standards; attendance alone and opening lectures for study do not guarantee passing. OWL Brightspace tracks time spent on each lecture, quiz, and exam, which may be used to identify irregularities or potential academic misconduct.

English Language and YouTube Captions
All lectures, including the Professor’s audio and PowerPoint slides, are in English and supplemented by expert guest speakers. Exams will assess this content. YouTube captions are available in multiple languages but may contain errors; students are responsible for any mistakes in captions. While videos may be translated, all quizzes and exams must be completed in English, as Western University is an English-speaking institution.

Lecture Backups
Lectures are also available on VoiceThread and as MP4 videos. If a link is broken in OWL Brightspace, email the Professor immediately at simpson@uwo.ca.

Due to the Professor’s busy schedule, no Zoom office hours can be scheduled outside of the two-hour time slot on Monday mornings, under any circumstances. 

Zoom is recorded: 
By attending the professor’s office hours, you consent to being recorded by the instructor and/or TA at the link under your Zoom Tool on the OWL website. The Teaching Assistant/Secondary Instructor does not hold Zoom office hours and will not request to meet with you by Zoom and/or in person.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):

If you have questions about the course outline, class material, or Mid-Term/Final Exam grades, email the Professor: simpson@uwo.ca

Due to the high number of students in the course, the Professor does not host live zoom meetings where students can ask questions. The Professor does not hold collective or individual meetings with students to discuss incorrect responses on quizzes or exams. Instead the Professor frequently posts Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

Generic questions are not addressed on a drop-in basis during Zoom office hours; however, frequently asked questions (FAQs) are occasionally answered through announcements. FAQs are archived under the Lessons Tool for all students.
 
Emergencies: 
None. You must use email and/or Zoom, not telephone messages or voice mail in all my classes. Do not under any circumstances leave any voice mail message(s) or texts on my cell or landlines. All our communications must be through Western’s email and/or by Zoom (recorded).  

Emails from non-Western Accounts:
The professor and assistants will read emails only from Western email accounts, subject lines should include the course number and a clear statement of purpose (e.g., “POLSCI 2141B I have a question about the quiz”). If the question requires more than a brief reply, a Teaching Assistant/Secondary Instructor may answer your query or you may be directed to attend the Professor’s Zoom office hours.

We do not read emails from non-Western accounts. We do not read texts during an exam-related emergency. 

Your email’s subject heading must say the Class Number and the nature of your question, like this: “POL SCI 2141A OWL Link to Exam does not open for me.” If the answer is not brief, then we will ask you to email a TA or meet the professor during Zoom office hours.  

For confidential concerns unrelated to medical or personal situations, you could make an appointment to see the professor (not the teaching or any other assistants) during Zoom office hours in a private break-out room. However, individual career or course advice is not provided and the Professor is not trained as a medical health professional to help you.

Course Materials:

Required Textbooks, Readings and Course Materials: 
No purchased items are necessary for this course, including textbooks, course readers, manuals, laboratory or safety materials, and specific electronic devices.
All the Required Readings, the instructor’s PowerPoint Slides and the “Engage More Readings” are accessible during the term on WESTERN’S ONLINE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, referred to as Owl Brightspace or OWL BS. Once the term is over, the materials are removed from the OWL site and are no longer accessible.
Copyright for all instructor's slides and lectures, including Guest Speaker lectures:
Copyright belongs to the instructor and not the University of Western Ontario. Reusing lecture material for other purposes is prohibited, even with written permission from Professor Erika Simpson and/or Accessible Education.
All required, supplementary, and optional PowerPoint Slides and lecture materials are the property of the instructor. Required Readings and “Engage More Readings” are sourced from online platforms such as Google Scholar, Scholarship@Western, and videos. They are collectively made available through Western’s library, and you can access them individually through the OWL BS portal.
Supplementary materials:
Supplementary materials, including lecture slides, handouts, videos, and career/essay writing advice, are regularly posted on OWL as Supplementary Lessons. These materials belong to the instructor and are protected by copyright; do not download, copy, or share without explicit written permission.


Methods of Evaluation:
Non-Cumulative Quizzes and Exams:
The quizzes and exams are not cumulative, meaning the Final Exam won’t include material covered before the Mid-term. Assessment is based solely on information presented by the professor and guest speakers, not on colleagues, search engines like Google, other websites, or external sources. The focus is strictly on course content and not external opinions or materials.

Exam Bank and Review Policy
The exam bank for each online assessment contains over 1,000 questions, which are randomly assigned to students. Students may request a review of their incorrect answers only four weeks after the completion of the Makeup #2 Quiz, Makeup #2 Midterm, or Makeup #2 Final Exam.
To review answers, students must contact the Professor to schedule an in-person meeting in the Professor’s office at a mutually agreed-upon time. Only incorrect answers may be discussed; correct answers are not subject to review.
Strict Academic Integrity Rules:
* It is a scholastic offence to take screenshots or photographs during any exam or quiz.
* It is a scholastic offence to take screenshots or photographs during the review meeting.
Any breach of these rules will be treated as a serious academic offence and reported to the Dean’s office in accordance with University policy.

Proctor track is not used: 
Proctor track is not utilized for Quizzes and/or two Exams due to widespread student privacy concerns. The Dean's office handles all cheating offense allegations. Students engaging in activities like sharing correct answers or taking screenshots may face consequences, such as referral to the Dean's Office, in-person exam rewrites with proctors, or potential expulsion. Decisions on such matters are made by the Dean's Office, not by Course Instructor Professor Simpson.

Search Engines (e.g. Google, CHATGBT):
It is important to recognize that the Professor emphasizes maintaining the integrity of the course's learning experience. Incorrect answers often result from Google searches and ChatGPT inaccuracies. These responses may appear sensible to those who did not attend the lectures, but they are incorrect as they were not covered in the lecture material.

The Quizzes close 10 minutes before the Exams commence:
Quiz #1 and the Mid-term Exam assess Lessons 1-6, typically scheduled before the Fall or Spring Study Breaks. Quiz #2 and the Final Exam cover Lessons 7-12, scheduled during the Official Exam Period. Both Quizzes close for all students 10 minutes before the Mid-term and/or Final Exam begins. 

Quizzes (10% EACH): 
Quiz #1 covers Lessons 1-6 and Quiz #2 covers Lessons 7-12 
Total Quizzes: 10% each = 20%  

You can retake each of the two multiple-choice quizzes up to three times, and only your highest score will be noted. Quiz #1 becomes accessible about 5 days before the Mid-Term Exam, while Quiz #2 opens around 5 days before the final day of classes. The highest scores from Quiz #1 and Quiz #2 are separately recorded, offering a rapid learning opportunity for score improvement. 

Exams (40% EACH): 
Mid-term Exam#1 covers Lessons 1-6 and Final Exam #2 covers Lessons 7-12 
Total Exams: 40% each = 80%  

The Mid-Term Exam consists of 80 multiple-choice questions to be completed within 2 hours, contributing 40% to your final grade. It covers Lessons 1-6 exclusively. Similarly, the non-cumulative Final exam features 80 multiple-choice questions within a 2-hour timeframe, also accounting for 40% of your final grade. This exam focuses on Lessons 7-12 only.

To pass this course, students must complete all quizzes and the midterm and final exams and achieve the minimum course grade to pass, as per university regulations. Failure to meet these requirements will result in an automatic failure in the course.

Final Exam:
The Final Exam's location, date, and time are To Be Confirmed [TBC] by the University. Students with Official Exam Conflicts (consult your Counsellor for the Form) must write a Makeup Exam, typically scheduled 1 week later, but possibly up to four weeks later. To miss and write a Makeup Exam, students need documented reasons and permission from their Academic Counsellor (not the Professor). After obtaining permission, students must promptly email the Professor and/or the Teaching Assistant to arrange the Makeup Exam time. 

Makeup Quizzes and Exams: (for more information, see Additional Statements below)
There is no Makeup Quiz unless you provide documentation to your Counselor covering the entire time from the time the Quiz is posted online until 10 minutes before the Exam begins.

To write Make-up Quizzes and/or Exams, documented reasons must be presented to Academic Counselling. Do not send your documentation to the Professor, as it is personal and confidential. The decision to allow a Make-up Exam is determined by your Academic Counsellor based on your individual situation. A Make-up Quiz is only possible with documentation covering the entire period from the time the Quiz was first posted until 10 minutes before the Final Exam.

Use of Electronic Devices and Handwritten/Typed Notes:
Electronic devices are prohibited during tests and examinations. Opening additional windows, PowerPoint slides, audio, or handwritten notes during quizzes and exams is not allowed. WTS personnel may check your OWL use after exam submission to ensure compliance. Any deviation can result in charges of cheating, handled by the Dean's office, not the Professor.

Quizzes and/or Exams are not Open Book or Open Computer:
Objective questions, not subjective ones, are assessed in both the two Quizzes and the two Exams. These questions require answers within 1 hour (Quizzes) or 2 hours (Exams) and are presented in multiple choice (A, B, C, D, E) format. Each Quiz consists of 40 objective questions, while each Exam includes 80 questions. The Required Readings are tested at the same time, using Multiple Choice questions that have ‘multiple’ correct answers, not ‘single’ correct answers.

Linear and randomized multiple choice questions:
The questions are randomized multiple-choice with single or multiple correct answers. These questions are presented linearly, preventing you from revisiting and reviewing your answers. No feedback is provided, and correct answers are not disclosed. The rationale behind this is to prevent the sharing of correct and incorrect answers publicly, preserving the integrity of the extensive Exam Bank each year. 

Calendar Tool (not Syllabus) shows Quiz, Mid-Term, and Final Exam Dates:
Refer to your Calendar Tool on WESTERN’S ONLINE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (OWL). for specific Quiz, Mid-term, and Make-up exam dates.

Reporting Exam Errors – Strict Policy
If an error occurs during an exam, Professor Simpson will adjust the grading in favor of the class. Students who notice an error must make hand-written notes and email the Professor at simpson@uwo.ca immediately after completing the exam. Include the verbatim question and all answer options in your report.
Zero-Tolerance Rules:
* Students must remain on the exam screen at all times.
* Screenshots or photographs are strictly forbidden. Any violation is a serious academic offence.
* Accidental screenshots or any attempt to capture exam content will result in immediate referral to the Dean’s office. No warnings or exceptions will be granted.
Compliance with these rules is mandatory. Any breach will be treated with the full severity of the University’s academic integrity policy.

Emergency Procedures during Examinations and Assembly Points:
In the event of WESTERN’S ONLINE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (OWL BS) collapse during an exam or the instructor's unavailability for an entire week, the Exam will be rescheduled and/or the Lesson will be canceled, and relevant slides for that day will be removed from OWL, eliminating the need for study.

If OWL experiences issues during Quizzes and/or Exams, an alternative exam, initially scheduled as a Make-up Exam, will be administered. If OWL faces a 5-day collapse during a Quiz, the Quiz will be reopened briefly once OWL stabilizes. 

If you encounter issues with OWL or there is an emergency during an exam or quiz, evacuate the area and go to the assembly points. Later, report the incident to WTS personnel via WTS Jira Ticket at https://wts.uwo.ca/service_desk.html or by calling 519 661-3800 (Ext. 83800) until 10 pm daily.

Communication in this class is restricted to email and/or Zoom. In an emergency, do not leave voice messages or texts on the instructor's cell or landlines. All communication must occur through Zoom or Western's email, with no phone calls answered.

Study Material, Notetaking Guidance, Memorization and Exam Rules:
In the event of missing a lecture, there is no need to report your absence through any online declaration system, and it's unnecessary to inform the instructor or teaching assistant. No additional documentation is required. However, all missed material, including PowerPoint Slides, Audio, Requied Readings, and Guest Speakers, will be covered in Quizzes and Exams. The assessments will encompass all content, and no Gradebook Items can be adjusted for absences or illnesses. If illness results in missing more than three weeks of lectures, it is advised to consult with your Academic Counsellor to discuss catch-up possibilities. However, as a steadfast policy, the instructor will not modify Quizzes or Exams to accommodate individual students' extended or short-term absences, regardless of the duration of their absence from classes. 

Students are required to memorize numerous dates and numbers for quizzes and exams. While it may be helpful to maintain a personal list for study purposes, no cheat sheets, paper notes, or electronic devices (including phones) may be used during any quiz or exam. Any violation of this rule constitutes a serious academic offence and will be reported to the Dean’s office.

If a detailed timeline, video, or map is presented on the Slides or linked via a URL, consider it testable material. The audio lecture will emphasize testable information, indicated by the Professor's spoken emphasis. In rare cases where a detailed picture, timeline, or map is not testable, it will be explicitly marked on the Slide as "NOT ON THE EXAM."

Exam Review and Cheating Policies:
We do not disclose individual correct or incorrect answers to students, preserving the integrity of our large Exam Banks. The Professor does not provide Mid-term Correct Answer sheets to prevent distribution and potential cheating in future cohorts. Viewing exams off-campus requires written permission from the Dean, and sharing with off-campus proctors is prohibited.

Study Groups and Academic Integrity:
The Professor cannot provide student email addresses or organize study groups without permission. While collaborative studying is encouraged, all exams must be completed individually.
Hiring or asking another person to complete an exam on your behalf—including friends who have previously engaged in academic misconduct—is a serious academic offence. Both parties involved may face disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion.

Note-Taking and Exam Preparation:
Handwritten or typed notes are optional but cannot be used during quizzes or exams. Last year’s notes are not useful, as we cover entirely new material. All PowerPoint slides and lecture audio are available online, including images, charts, diagrams, and maps, which are all testable.
Some students use transcript generators (e.g., Kome YouTube Transcript Generator) or AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT 3.5) to create practice questions. However, the course and exam questions include distractor words and invisible images designed to prevent AI from giving reliable answers. Using AI during quizzes or exams is strictly prohibited and may result in a significantly lower grade than if you studied the lectures and readings directly.
This course is designed for learning, not just boosting your GPA. Academic dishonesty undermines your education and may have long-term consequences.

Memorizing Dates, Numbers and Maps:
You are required to memorize numerous dates and numbers. You are required to study the pictures, maps and URL links that are explored during the lectures. Many students find it helpful to maintain a separate list of these details to review a few days before the Mid-term or Final Exams.

If a detailed timeline, video, or map is presented in the Required Readings, on the Slides or linked via a URL, consider it testable material. The audio lecture will emphasize testable information, indicated by the Professor's spoken emphasis. In rare cases where a detailed picture, timeline, or map is not testable, it will be explicitly marked on the Slide as "NOT ON THE EXAM."

Availability of Marks on your Gradebook:
Mid-term exam marks will be available before the drop date and/or before writing the final exam. 
The professor updates your marks before the drop date and/or final exam, providing information on all your marks except for the final exam mark. However, if you miss Quiz #1 and/or the Mid-term Exam, you must see an Academic Counselor. Since Academic Counselling may be delayed by a week or more, your Gradebook may change after the drop date and/or final exam.  

Cheating detection software is employed after your quiz mark appears on your Gradebook:
As computer-marked multiple-choice tests and/or exams will be administered, software will be used to identify unusual coincidences in answer patterns that may indicate cheating. Therefore, "Computer-marked multiple-choice tests and/or exams may be subject to submission for similarity review by software that will check for unusual coincidences in answer patterns that may indicate cheating."

Exams, quizzes and make-up exams will be different for each student:
The Professor frequently updates PowerPoint slides and creates new multiple-choice questions. The Exam Banks are very large, and you will not write the same exam as other students in the class because your quizzes and exams are randomized. The answers are randomized. And the order of questions is randomized. 

Early exam date and ‘wrong answers’ on OWL cannot be accommodated:
Once the final exam schedule is posted on OWL, you cannot arrange to take any quizzes or exams early. 

Rewriting exams or assignments after submission is generally not allowed, except in exceptional circumstances assessed by the Dean's office.

If you submit the "wrong answer" and wish to provide the "right version," consult your Academic Counsellor. The decision will be made in collaboration with the Professor.

Missing classes does not result in mark reweighting for absences. Permission from your Academic Counsellor is required for any adjustments, and you should consult them, not the Professor.


Additional Statements:

Scholastic offences:

University policies on scholastic offences:
Scholastic offences are taken seriously, and students are directed to read the appropriate policy, specifically, the definition of what constitutes a Scholastic Offence, at the following Web site: 
http://www.uwo.ca/univsec/handbook/appeals/scholastic_discipline_undergrad.pdf 

That policy reads: 

“Scholastic Offences include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. Plagiarism, which may be defined as “The act or an instance of copying or stealing another’s words or ideas and attributing them as one’s own.” Excerpted from Black’s Law Dictionary, West Group, 1999, 7th ed., p. 1170. This concept applies with equal force to all assignments, including laboratory reports, diagrams, and computer projects. Students wishing more detailed information should consult their instructor, Department Chair, or Dean’s Office. In addition, they may seek guidance from a variety of current style manuals available in the University’s libraries. Information about these resources can be found at: http://www.lib.uwo.ca/services/styleguides.html
2. Cheating on an examination or falsifying material subject to academic evaluation. 
3. Submitting false or fraudulent assignments or credentials; or falsifying records, transcripts or other academic documents. 
4. Submitting a false medical or other such certificate under false pretences. 
5. a) Improperly obtaining, through theft, bribery, collusion or otherwise, an examination paper prior to the date and time for writing such an examination. b) Unauthorized possession of an examination paper, however obtained, prior to the date and time for writing such an examination, unless the student reports the matter to the instructor, the relevant Department, or the Registrar as soon as possible after receiving the paper in question. 
6. Impersonating a candidate at an examination or availing oneself of the results of such an impersonation. 
7. Intentionally interfering in any way with any person's scholastic work. 
8. Submitting for credit in any course or program of study, without the knowledge and written approval of the instructor to whom it is submitted, any academic work for which 6 credit has been obtained previously or is being sought in another course or program of study in the University or elsewhere. 
9. Aiding or abetting any such offence.” 
For example, if you submit a paper written for a previous or concurrent course, you are committing a scholastic offense. Instead, you must produce new work for each class (unless you have obtained the written permission of all course instructors involved). 


Scholastic offence to search for ‘right’ answers during exams:
During the exams, it is prohibited and not anticipated for you to search through saved PowerPoint Slides or your notes. You are expected to have a thorough understanding of the material to respond to the randomized questions. Attempting to search for answers using Control-F or Google during the online tests is considered an academic offense, and there isn't sufficient time for such actions. Additionally, cheating students may score much lower, as the Professor utilizes Google and Chat GBT to formulate incorrect answers. 

Attendance and Examination Policy if you miss quizzes and/or exams:
Failure to attend the Mid-term, Final Exams, or Make-up Exams will result in automatic course failure. Even if you excel in the Final Exam covering Lessons 7-12 --after missing the Mid-term Exam on Lessons 1-6 -- course failure is inevitable. 

A student is entitled to be examined in courses maintained in registration, but with limitations:
- A student may be barred from the final examination due to unsatisfactory academic standing throughout the year.
- Excessive absences, as determined by the instructor, may lead to reporting to the Dean of the offering Faculty after due warning. This condition must be explicitly outlined in the course syllabus. "Due warning" implies a personal email before reaching the specified threshold of absences.
- Based on the Department's recommendation and with the Dean's permission, the student may be prevented from taking the regular examination for the course.


Learning Objectives:

By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Recognize various key figures, events, and trends in recent international relations history.
- Engage with various political theories in the realm of international relations.
- Analyse various international issues, situating them within their historical context.
- Establish various connections between contemporary problems, historical events, and their global context.

Learning Objectives Lecture Slides: 
While reviewing the Slides and listening to the audio lectures, including the guest lectures, your main focus should be on contemplating and questioning the material, not on extensive note-taking like a medieval scribe. Although the professor understands that some students prefer reinforcing lecture material with many handwritten or typewritten notes, it is unnecessary due to all the Slides and audio being posted on OWL as YouTube links, MP4 files and PowerPoint slides. 

You are encouraged to engage with the content of the slides and required readings, and think about them, rather than taking copious notes. Many students find reviewing by studying the Slides without audio to be effective; however most if not all the guest speakers refrain from using PowerPoint Slides. It is common practice in government, among non-governmental organization and in the working world, to refrain from using slides – and to rely on the spoken word. Rarely, guest speaker use Slides so you must take notes or rely on YouTube transcripts in order to study the guest speakers. 



Support Services: 

Non-Medical and Medical Accommodation:
For work totalling 10% or more of the final course grade, you must provide valid medical or supporting documentation to the Academic Counselling Office of your Faculty of Registration as soon as possible. 
Instructors must explain how they will handle accommodation for medical illness affecting less than 10% of the course grade. The exams and quizzes are worth 10% of the course grade, therefore students must see their Academic Counsellor for all accommodations. For absences worth more than 10% of the course grade, students should consult their Academic Counsellor and are not obligated to disclose confidential medical information to the professor.

Social Science Academic Counselling Services and Medical Illness Policies: 
Please visit the Social Science Academic Counselling webpage for information on adding/dropping courses, academic considerations for absences, appeals, exam conflicts, and many other academic related matters. 
For further information, please consult the University’s medical illness policy at https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/accommodation_medi cal.pdf. 
The Student Medical Certificate is available at https://www.uwo.ca/univsec/pdf/academic_policies/appeals/medicalform.pdf
Medical or non-medical accommodation documentation should be submitted to the appropriate University counselling office, and definitely not the instructor.

Please note: Multiple-choice questions on exams and quiz/exam dates cannot be changed for accommodation reasons. Students must consult the Calendar Tool to find out the date(s) of Makeup Quizzes and Exams. Then they must inform their counselor and take the earliest possible makeup.

Religious Accommodation:
When a course requirement conflicts with a religious holiday that requires an absence from the University or prohibits certain activities, students should request accommodation for their absence in writing at least two weeks prior to the holiday to the course instructor and/or the Academic Counselling office of their Faculty of Registration. 
Please consult University's list of recognized religious holidays (updated annually) at https://multiculturalcalendar.com/ecal/index.php?s=c-univwo.

SENSITIVE CONTENT AND DESCRIPTIONS OF WAR AND VIOLENCE
Some students might find the Content and pictures on some PowerPoint Slides upsetting. The Slides deal with strong adult themes concerning violence, death, war, abuse (torture), international and national conflict as well as political or religious affiliation, substance abuse, illegal activities, and other adverse health or mental heath issues including mental illness, drug and alcohol addition, hate speech or strong abusive language.  
Viewers may not use the Content in any manner that would be deemed offensive or in connection with a subject that would be controversial or unflattering to a reasonable person.
There may be sensitive topics or images in the content that might be triggering to someone who experienced war, trauma or an abusive situation.
Sensitive Content Notice in the Lessons (examples):
This week’s lessons contain content that may be challenging to deal with now, in the context of….. (fill in the blank using lesson title), and I want to flag it now. The content is used in the course to provide a real-world example for applying what you are learning about international crises, global violence, global diplomacy, and/or Canada abroad.
As the course instructor, I want to do my best to make any conversations we have either online or in class about this content feel safe for you. If clips from pictures or documentary are shown, they are neither meant as an endorsement nor as a criticism of the content. If you have thoughts to share with me about this, please do send me a note: simpson@uwo.ca

We encourage you to check out the Digital Student Experience website to manage your academics and well-being: https://www.uwo.ca/se/digital/
Additional student-run support services are offered by the USC, https://westernusc.ca/services/


Additional regulations on course re-evaluation, absences, and evaluation of international students:

Refer to the APPENDIX TO UNDERGRADUATE COURSE OUTLINES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, located in the folder within this section of the Syllabus, for additional university and departmental regulations applicable to this course. Note: You are responsible for reading and adhering to the APPENDIX and the INFORMATION BELOW, although we do not cover this information during class time.

Updated Policies:
Please refer to student services for the updated Policy on Accommodation for Medical Illness and Student Medical Certificate. 
If you have medical illness or other documentation, present it to the Dean's Office or an Academic Counsellor in your Faculty. They will assess whether accommodation is possible. 
Follow Student Services, Dean's Office, or your Academic Counsellor's instructions for documenting any medical absences. 
Academic Counseling will inform the Professor about accommodation, and decisions on due dates, re-weighting, and/or transfer weighting will be decided in consultation with you and your Academic Counsellor, not the Professor. 
Do not meet with the professor to discuss reasons for accommodation on medical or non-medical grounds.

Handwritten or Typed Notes and/or Electronic Devices:
You may not use additional electronic devices, such as cellphones, personal computers, or electronic dictionaries, during any exams.

Regarding Scanitron, Proctorio, and Proctor track:
Exam questions are created by professors and objective questions are marked by university-approved multiple-choice computer-marking systems like 'OWL,' 'Scanitron,' 'Proctorio,' or 'Turnitin.' Professor Simpson does not use Proctor track.

"Special exams" may have different content, structure, and format than regularly scheduled exams. The specific format will be announced by the Professor, Dean, or Chair, but most cases involve objective questions (e.g., multiple choice, blank answers, T/F).

If you miss too many mid-term or final exams, you may have to write a combined multiple-choice and essay-type exam, with essay-style answers. For instance, missing the third make-up for the mid-term exam means the fourth make-up exam will consist of essay-style (not multiple choice) questions. This is due to the professor's large exam bank not being large enough for various multiple-choice makeup exams.

Appeals:
Appeals to change an exam or essay grade must be submitted during the term of instruction, as the Course Instructor does not handle appeals after the term ends.

If there are changes to the Official Course Outline:
Under certain circumstances, such as the illness or death of the course instructor, you will be notified through all available communication channels, and a replacement instructor will be assigned promptly.

Lecture, simulation, and exam dates and topics may be adjusted due to schedules, illnesses, or unforeseen events. The dates in this course outline are for illustration purposes and may be updated on the class website as the term progresses.

Mask Policy: 
University policy may require instructors and students to wear non-medical face masks in all common-use indoor spaces on campus, including classrooms. For the complete Health & Safety mask policy, visit https://www.uwo.ca/coronavirus/healthsafety/index.html

Vaccination Policy:  
Western has protocols for any member of the University community coming onto campus, explained here: https://www.uwo.ca/coronavirus/health-safety/index.html#before
Students with questions can contact the Student Health Care clinic at 519-661-3030.
